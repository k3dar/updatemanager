SolydXK Update Manager
======================

Please, help translating: https://www.transifex.com/solydxk/updatemanager/dashboard/

Update Manager (UM) for SolydXK.
This is a total rework of the previous UM where Apt is the update mechanism instead of Synaptic.
Choosing Apt will prevent any discrepancies between Terminal upgrades and UM upgrades.

For a detailed discription of the process flow, see updatemanager-processflow.png

Upgrade information, including the pre- and post-scripts are stored on the server.
See _serverfiles for examples.
